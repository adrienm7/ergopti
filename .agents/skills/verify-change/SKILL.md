# Verifying a change

A green suite is not evidence unless it is the suite that covers what you
changed. The AHK runner and the JS gate cover **disjoint ground**.

## 1. Let the tool pick the gates

```bash
node ./tools/test/verify-change.cjs           # run every gate this change needs
node ./tools/test/verify-change.cjs --plan    # just show which gates, and why
node ./tools/test/verify-change.cjs --all     # explicit full audit, not a micro-commit prerequisite
node ./tools/test/verify-change.cjs --all --diagnose  # classify extra historical/environment reds
node ./tools/test/verify-change.cjs --range=origin/dev..HEAD
```

It reads the working tree (or a range), maps each file to the gates that can
catch a regression in it, prints that reasoning, then runs them and exits
non-zero on failure. Prefer it over remembering the table below.

The default change-scoped run is the commit gate. `--all` is an explicit audit;
it can expose unrelated historical debt. `--all --diagnose` classifies a red as
a candidate regression when the current diff selects that gate, baseline/history
when the extra gate does not cover the diff, or environment when the command
could not run. Classification is triage, not exoneration: inspect the exact
assertion and reproduce it against the baseline before calling it unrelated.

A small isolated edit does not require a persistent plan merely because an
unrelated full-audit check is red. If every gate selected by the edit passes,
report the historical red separately. Multi-file campaigns, audit queues, and
high-risk state migrations still deserve a durable plan proportional to scope.

## 2. Two silent failures it checks first

Both are instant, and both describe bugs that a **passing** suite hides.

- **A test file that `run_all.ahk` does not `#Include` never runs.** The suite
  reports a pass that proves nothing about the fix it was written for.
- **`_DriverFuncBody("Name")` returns `""` for a name it cannot find**, so every
  ABSENCE assertion built on it passes vacuously. AHK v2 makes this sharper than
  it looks: a call to a function that does not exist is _not_ a load-time error —
  the name resolves as a variable — and production call sites are usually wrapped
  in `try`, so a typo or a half-finished rename yields a green test, no error and
  no log line anywhere.

Guard every source-scanning test with `Assert(Body != "", …)` for this reason.

## 3. The file-to-gate map, and why each pairing exists

| You touched                                 | Gate that catches it                      | Why it is not obvious                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| any `.ahk`                                  | `test:ahk-encoding`                       | a lost BOM or a stray CRLF breaks the parser in ways the error message does not explain |
| `windows/**.ahk`                            | AHK `run_all.ahk`                         | the unit + meta suite                                                                   |
| `windows/**.ahk` outside `tests/`           | AHK `e2e/run_e2e.ahk`                     | behaviour, not just structure                                                           |
| an `ADAPTER_*` map, `_shared/core/ports/**` | **`test:js`**                             | port compliance runs ONLY in the JS gate                                                |
| `_shared/**`, any shared constant           | **`test:js`** (+ `test:hs`, `test:linux`) | single-source and cross-driver parity checks                                            |
| `locales/**`, any user-facing string        | **`test:js`**                             | the translations audit                                                                  |
| `macos/**`                                  | `test:hs`                                 | —                                                                                       |
| `linux/**`                                  | `test:linux`                              | —                                                                                       |
| section banners, anything                   | `lint:conventions:strict`                 | already enforced by the pre-commit hook                                                 |

**The row that has actually bitten us:** adding one name to an `ADAPTER_*`
contract map left the AHK suite at a full 3380/3380 green while the
cross-driver port contract was broken. `test:js` was the only thing that saw it.
That map declares the port every driver must satisfy — a Windows-only helper
belongs in the adapter file but **not** in the map.

## 4. What "the full local gate" means

`npm run test:js` is the one that gets skipped and the one that matters: it wraps
the pinned-source-read ratchet, `lint:conventions:strict`, port compliance,
priority parity, the translations audit and the TOML format check. **A green AHK
suite can still ship a red CI.**

If `test:js` reports fewer than 66 checks or any `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`, the gate did
not run — install dependencies first.

## 5. Before committing

Run the gates, then follow `ship-fix` (regression test encoding the root cause)
and `commit-and-push` (one fix per commit, never push `dev` or `main`). The
pre-commit hook enforces conventions but knows nothing about the suites — it is
not a substitute for this step.
