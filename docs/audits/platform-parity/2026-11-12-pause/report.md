# Pause: configuration stays available (first pass)

## Scope

Maintainer decision EDD-1 (2026-11-12), sharpened the same day into a « real
pause »: while the driver is paused, every configuration and install action
stays available, and everything that acts on typing stays inert. This pass
removes the pause gates on the menus' whole-scope restore and clear and on
opening the physical shortcuts editor, on macOS and Linux. Windows
(`windows/**`) is the read-only reference; its counterpart is in `TODO.md`
« Windows (the PC agent's) ».

## Fixed (macOS and Linux)

| Sequence                                                           | Before                                                                                                                                                      | Regression                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Pause, then open the physical shortcuts editor                     | Linux and macOS menus refused to open it                                                                                                                    | `edd1-paused-writes` (physical editor menu)        |
| Pause, then « restore recommended » or « clear » in a feature menu | Every scope owner refused: Linux script, tap-hold, hotstrings, shortcuts, key combinations; macOS scoped preferences, gestures, layout, metrics, AI restore | `edd1-paused-writes` in each scope suite           |
| Pause, then the Configuration menu's restore or clear              | Linux refused the composition; macOS greyed both rows and stripped their handler                                                                            | global scope suites, shared Configuration contract |
| Pause, then edit an ordered key combination or its delay (Linux)   | The pair owner refused its configuration source while paused                                                                                                | `edd1-paused-writes` (ordered pair, delay)         |

The typing runtime keeps its pause: the Linux pair owner's runtime capture,
action capture and engine admission still require an unpaused driver, which
the paused-custody regression asserts.

## Left (next pass)

- The tray's feature rows still grey while paused (`greyed_when_paused`).
- Per-row configuration gates inside the submenus (hotstrings, shortcuts,
  gestures, metrics, AI settings, keyboard groups) and install actions.
- The audit that every typing feature is inert while paused, layout
  emulation first, and that a setting changed during a pause applies on
  resume.
- The macOS Configuration menu's unused-key clean stays greyed while paused:
  not part of the restore/clear decision; listed for the coordinator.
