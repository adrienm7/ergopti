# Adversarial audit

Adopt an adversarial stance: the goal is not to confirm the code works, it is to
find the input, state or timing that breaks it.

## The four guarantees

Audit against these, and state which one each finding violates:

- **G1 — Robustness.** No unhandled exception, crash or keyboard lock-up in *any*
  state: normal, suspended, paused, mid-layout-switch, mid-config-reload,
  updater-poll, cold start, first boot.
- **G2 — No missing output.** No silent no-op: every user action produces its
  effect or a loud failure.
- **G3 — No races.** Every async boundary (timer, hook, InputHook, HTTP, watcher)
  is safe against reentrancy and out-of-order completion.
- **G4 — No lag.** No perceptible latency on any hot path.

## Method

1. **Map the entry points** — every hotkey, hook, timer, watcher, menu action,
   external trigger.
2. **Audit module by module**, then **flow by flow** end-to-end. Module-local
   review misses the interaction bugs, which are the expensive ones.
3. **Question every async boundary.** What happens if it fires twice? Out of
   order? While suspended? Before init? After teardown?
4. **Loop until dry.** Keep sweeping until two consecutive passes surface nothing
   new. A fixed finding count means you stopped early, not that the code is clean.

Bug classes worth a dedicated sweep: unguarded map/table access, state read
before init, load-time vs runtime registration, missing suspend guards, swallowed
exceptions, non-reentrant handlers, sync I/O on a hot path.

## Proof discipline — every finding must carry

1. **A concrete repro sequence** — the exact steps and state.
2. **The root cause**, not the symptom.
3. **Why it is silent today** — what swallows the error or hides the no-op.
4. **Severity + confidence**, stated separately.
5. **A regression test encoding the root cause** (see `ship-fix`, `meta-test`).

A finding without a repro path is a hypothesis. Label it as one.

## The evidence rule — read this twice

**Re-derive every artifact you cite, from the artifact itself, before citing it.**

The cautionary tale here is a **refutation that was wrong**, which is worse than
the finding it killed. The second 2026-07-20 audit declared the first audit's
performance section fabricated — "zero `Slow` lines exist in any log". A third
pass re-derived the disputed figures independently and got them *exactly*:
`Tooltip.ResolvePos` max 2560.3 ms, `OnChar` max 701.3 ms, 8 958 `Slow` lines
across 10 days. The debunker had searched `<ConfigDir>/ahk/logs/` — a directory
that never existed — instead of `<ConfigDir>/autohotkey/logs/`
(`_AhkSubDir := "autohotkey\"`), and `<ConfigDir>` is itself redirected by
`%APPDATA%\Ergopti\paths.toml`. A real 2.5-second stall on the typing path was
dismissed as unmeasured and stayed open an extra cycle.

Consequences to internalise:

- **Hold refutations to the same standard as findings.** "This evidence does not
  exist" is a positive claim about the world and needs proof of where you looked.
  Absence of evidence at the wrong path is not evidence of absence.
- **Resolve the config path before concluding anything about logs.** `paths.toml`
  first, then the driver's subdirectory constant.
- **Never present a sub-agent's or tool's output as measured evidence** without
  opening the artifact yourself. Aggregating an unverified claim launders it.
- **Cheapest possible check first**, run at the *correct* path:
  `awk 'index($0,"Slow")>0{c++} END{print c+0}' <log>`.
- **Be fair when you suspect fabrication.** Prefer "I could not locate the artifact
  at X, Y, Z — where should I look?" over "this was invented".
- **Label the provenance of every claim.** "Derived from reading the code" is a
  perfectly respectable basis for a finding. Dressing it up as a measurement is
  not. G4 in particular is unmeasured on this driver unless you have a log line
  to quote.
- Where logs live: `<ConfigDir>/autohotkey/logs/` — note the subdirectory is
  `autohotkey`, not `ahk`, and `<ConfigDir>` is redirected by
  `%APPDATA%\Ergopti\paths.toml` (on the maintainer's machine, to
  `D:\Documents\GitHub\config\ergopti_plus\`). There is a dedicated errors-only
  sink and 14-day retention. Getting this path wrong is precisely what produced
  the false refutation above. Files found elsewhere (e.g. `D:\tmp`) may be **test
  harness output** rather than driver output — check before attributing them.
- Caveat when dating events: the log **filename carries the date the driver
  started, not the date of the entries** (the path is resolved once at init), so a
  file named `..._07-11.log` can hold entries from the 14th. Read the line's own
  timestamp; never date an event from the filename.

## Deliverable

Unless asked otherwise: `AUDIT_<SCOPE>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` at the repo root, with
executive summary, findings by severity, performance (with provenance labelled),
PROJECT_MEMORY watch-list status, and a coverage register of what was and was not
examined. Be explicit about coverage gaps — silence reads as "covered".

## Constraint

Never propose weakening or deleting a test to make a change pass.
